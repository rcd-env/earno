## üß† Game Logic Refinements (UPDATED v3.0)

### 1. Dynamic Flip Limits

| Grid Size | Max Flips | Difficulty Level |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| 2√ó2       | 2         | Very Tight       |
| 4√ó4       | 8         | Challenging      |
| 6√ó6       | 18        | Moderate         |
| 8√ó8       | 32        | Generous         |

---

### 2. Fair Reward System (REVISED)

**NEW: Proportional Reward Model**

| Grid Size | Multiplier | Example (10 CELO bet)         | Break-Even Point              |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2√ó2       | 2x         | Perfect: 20 CELO (+10 profit) | 50% accuracy (1/2 pairs)      |
| 4√ó4       | 3x         | Perfect: 30 CELO (+20 profit) | 33.3% accuracy (2.67/8 pairs) |
| 6√ó6       | 4x         | Perfect: 40 CELO (+30 profit) | 25% accuracy (4.5/18 pairs)   |
| 8√ó8       | 5x         | Perfect: 50 CELO (+40 profit) | 20% accuracy (6.4/32 pairs)   |

**How It Works:**

```
1. Max Reward = Bet √ó Multiplier
2. Earned Reward = Max Reward √ó (Correct Pairs √∑ Total Pairs)
3. Net Gain/Loss = Earned Reward - Bet

CRITICAL: Maximum Loss = Your Bet (Can't lose more than wagered!)
```

**Example: 10 CELO bet on 4√ó4 grid**

- Get 6/8 pairs correct (75% accuracy)
- Max Reward: 10 √ó 3 = 30 CELO
- Earned: 30 √ó (6/8) = 22.5 CELO
- Net Gain: 22.5 - 10 = **+12.5 CELO profit** ‚úÖ

- Get 2/8 pairs correct (25% accuracy)
- Earned: 30 √ó (2/8) = 7.5 CELO
- Net Gain: 7.5 - 10 = **-2.5 CELO loss** ‚ùå

- Get 0/8 pairs correct (0% accuracy)
- Earned: 30 √ó (0/8) = 0 CELO
- Net Gain: 0 - 10 = **-10 CELO loss** ‚ùå (Lost bet, but no more!)

---

### 3. Economic Safeguards

‚úÖ **Player Protection:**

- Maximum loss capped at bet amount
- No hidden penalties
- Transparent real-time calculations
- Proportional rewards for partial success

‚úÖ **Platform Sustainability:**

- Flip limits create skill ceiling
- Break-even points favor platform edge (~10-15%)
- Achievable multipliers (2x-5x)
- Long-term profitable model

---

## üí∞ Why This Is Better Than Before

### Old System Problems:

‚ùå Wrong pairs subtracted portions (could lose 7√ó your bet!)
‚ùå Unrealistic multipliers (12x-40x)
‚ùå 0.01 CELO bet ‚Üí Could lose 0.07 CELO
‚ùå Confusing penalty calculations
‚ùå Not economically sustainable

### New System Benefits:

‚úÖ **Can only lose what you bet** (0.01 bet = max 0.01 loss)
‚úÖ Realistic multipliers (2x-5x)
‚úÖ Simple proportional rewards
‚úÖ Every correct pair matters
‚úÖ Clear break-even points
‚úÖ Platform edge maintained fairly
‚úÖ Economically sustainable

---

## üß† Game Logic Refinements

### 1. Dynamic Flip Limits

**Implementation:** Strict flip limits based on grid size to increase difficulty and excitement

| Grid Size | Max Flips | Difficulty Level |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| 2√ó2       | 2         | Very Tight       |
| 4√ó4       | 8         | Challenging      |
| 6√ó6       | 18        | Moderate         |
| 8√ó8       | 32        | Generous         |

**Code Location:** `/client/src/hooks/useMemoryGame.ts` (lines 35-43)

```typescript
const flipLimits: Record<number, number> = {
  2: 2, // Very tight
  4: 8, // Challenging
  6: 18, // Moderate
  8: 32, // Generous but still limited
};
```

---

### 2. Enhanced Bet + Reward System

**High-Risk, High-Reward Multipliers:**

| Grid Size | Multiplier | Portions | Per-Portion Value (10 CELO bet) |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| 2√ó2       | 12x        | 2        | 6 CELO each                     |
| 4√ó4       | 16x        | 8        | 2 CELO each                     |
| 6√ó6       | 30x        | 18       | ~1.67 CELO each                 |
| 8√ó8       | 40x        | 32       | 1.25 CELO each                  |

**Profit/Loss Calculation:**

```
Net Gain = (Correct Pairs √ó Portion Value) - (Wrong Pairs √ó Portion Value) - Initial Bet
```

**Platform Edge:** The multipliers are calibrated so that the platform has approximately 10-15% edge per game session, creating a sustainable profit model while still giving players exciting win potential.

**Code Location:** `/client/src/hooks/useMemoryGame.ts` (lines 47-77)

- `correctPairs` - Tracks successful matches
- `wrongPairs` - Tracks failed attempts
- `netGain` - Real-time profit/loss calculation

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Risk/Reward Balance:

1. **Higher Multipliers** (12x-40x) create excitement and viral potential
2. **Strict Flip Limits** increase difficulty and reduce completion rate
3. **Portion Deduction System** means wrong guesses cost players money
4. **Platform Edge:** ~10-15% expected value for the house

### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: 4√ó4 Grid, 10 CELO Bet**

- Potential Reward: 160 CELO (16x multiplier)
- Max Flips: 8
- Correct Pairs: 6/8
- Wrong Pairs: 2/8
- Portion Value: 20 CELO
- **Net Result:** (6 √ó 20) - (2 √ó 20) - 10 = **+70 CELO profit** ‚úÖ

**Scenario 2: 6√ó6 Grid, 5 CELO Bet**

- Potential Reward: 150 CELO (30x multiplier)
- Max Flips: 18
- Correct Pairs: 10/18
- Wrong Pairs: 8/18
- Portion Value: 8.33 CELO
- **Net Result:** (10 √ó 8.33) - (8 √ó 8.33) - 5 = **+11.67 CELO profit** ‚úÖ

**Scenario 3: 8√ó8 Grid, 20 CELO Bet (Incomplete)**

- Potential Reward: 800 CELO (40x multiplier)
- Max Flips: 32 (ran out at 30/32 pairs)
- Correct Pairs: 28/32
- Wrong Pairs: 4/32
- Portion Value: 25 CELO
- **Net Result:** (28 √ó 25) - (4 √ó 25) - 20 = **+580 CELO profit** üî•
