## How to Add Screenshots

1. Play the game and take screenshots at appropriate moments
2. Use browser developer tools to capture clean screenshots (F12 > Device toolbar)
3. Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or 1440x900
4. Save as PNG format for best quality
5. Name files exactly as listed above
6. Place them in this directory

## Tips for Good Screenshots

- Use light/dark mode that best showcases the UI
- Ensure wallet addresses are visible but can be blurred if needed
- Show realistic gameplay scenarios
- Use testnet CELO amounts (not production amounts)
- Make sure UI elements are clearly visible
- Avoid showing browser toolbars/bookmarks in screenshots

## Alternative: Create Wireframes

If you prefer wireframes instead of actual screenshots:

- Use tools like Figma, Sketch, or Excalidraw
- Create mockups that show the UI layout and key features
- Save as PNG and use the same filenames
